1.(a) Compute the rank of A;
(b) Provide the characteristic polynomial for A and compute the eigenvalues of A.
(c) Let ui be the i-th column of A for i = 1, 2, 3. Use the GramSchmidt process to generate an orthonormal basis from {u1, u2, u3}.

2.  Determine all the independent univariate random variables.
(b) What is the probability density function for x1 + 2x2?
(c) Let x := [x1 x2] and y: = [y1] Determine the conditional distribution density function p(y|x) and p(x|y = 1).

3.  Compute ∇f;
(b) Find the solutions for ∇f(x) = 0;
(c) Starting at a value [1 2 0] and consider learning rates {1, 1/2} Execute two steps of the gradient descent algorithm foreach learning rate separately. Discuss the outcomes and also compare the result with item (b) (whether they are distancing from points in (b) or getting closer)?
