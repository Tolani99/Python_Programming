The Pig Latin derivation project involves creating a program or script that converts regular English text into Pig Latin. Pig Latin is a playful language transformation used for amusement, often in word games or as a form of coded communication among friends. The transformation rules for converting English words into Pig Latin typically follow these guidelines:

Basic Rules:

For words starting with a consonant, move the consonant cluster to the end of the word and add "ay."
For words starting with a vowel, add "way" or "ay" at the end of the word, depending on the preferred convention.
Handling Special Cases:

Words that begin with consonant clusters move all the consonants to the end and add "ay." (e.g., "glove" becomes "oveglay").
Words that begin with vowel sounds just add "way" or "ay" to the end. (e.g., "egg" becomes "eggway" or "eggay").
The Pig Latin derivation project would involve writing a program that accepts English text as input and processes it to output the equivalent text transformed into Pig Latin based on these rules. It typically includes the following steps:

Tokenizing the input text into individual words.
Applying the rules of Pig Latin transformation to each word.
Reassembling the transformed words back into a sentence or paragraph.
