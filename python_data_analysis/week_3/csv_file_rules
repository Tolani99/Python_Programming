Most well-formed CSV files adhere to the following "rules":

1. Fields are separated by a single delimiter character, which is often a comma (,).

2. Rows are separated by a newline character.

3. Fields are interpreted as plain text.

4. Fields can be quoted by a quote character, which is often a double quote (").

5. Quoted fields can contain the delimiter character and/or newlines within them.

6. Each row contains the same number of fields in the same order.
